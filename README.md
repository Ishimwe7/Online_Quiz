**1. What is Logging?**  
Logging is the process of recording information about a program's execution to understand its behavior,
diagnose issues, and track events. Logs can include messages, errors, warnings, and other information.

**2. Why Logging is Important**   
***Debugging***: Helps in identifying and resolving issues.  
***Monitoring***: Tracks the application's performance and behavior.   
****Auditing***: Provides a history of events for security and compliance.   
***Maintenance***: Aids in maintaining and improving the application over time.   
**3. Understanding Logging Levels**   
Logging levels define the severity of the messages being logged:  

***TRACE***: Fine-grained debugging information.   
***DEBUG***: Detailed information for diagnosing issues.   
***INFO***: General information about the application's running state.   
***WARN***: Potentially harmful situations.   
***ERROR***: Error events that might still allow the application to continue running.   
***FATAL***: Severe error events that will presumably lead the application to abort.
